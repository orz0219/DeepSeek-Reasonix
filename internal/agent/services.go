// agentServices are the collaborators an Agent talks to, separated from the
// state it remembers. This is not a lifetime: the controller rebinds most of
// these between turns through the Set* seams, and fork wraps prov mid-run. A
// nil field is a capability the host did not wire, which each reader handles.

	// gate is the per-call permission gate for both standard and Plan
	// workflows. nil disables gating entirely.

	// captures preimages before tools run and fingerprints after, regardless of
	// outcome. Never changes provider-visible schemas or prompts.
